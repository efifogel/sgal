# Xenia

# Introduction
Xenia is a company that develops a cloud service that generates optimal (or near optimal) store plans in real time.

SGAL supports the construction and maintenance of directed acyclic graphs that represent scenes and models in three-dimensional space.
Install SGAL by following the instructions there.

Ideally, setting up xenia amounts to:

cd <build-directory>
cmake <install-directory>
make
