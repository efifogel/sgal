# Test of using identical keys in an OrientationInterpolator.
# An OrientationInterpolator node is used to change the orientation of a Box
# geometry.  The fraction_changed eventOut of a TimeSensor node is used
# to change the orientation from keyValues of 0, +90, 180, 270 and 360 degrees
# for the X, Y and Z axis respectively. However, the Z axis orientation has
# identical keys for all of its keyValues, and as a result, only the first and
# last keyValues are used as limits. As a result: the Box geometry will only
# rotate about the X and Y axis, but will not rotate about the Z axis.
