# Test an OrientationInterpolators' ability to continue to receive and generate
# events when it is no longer part of the transformantion hierarchy.  The
# OrientationInterpolator in this world is "switched"out by setting its parent
# Switch node's whichChoice value to "-1" . The result should be:  the
# OrientationInterpolator should continue to rotate the Sphere in this
# world 360 degrees about the X, Y and Z axis, even though it has been
# "switched out".
