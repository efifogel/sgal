# A PositionInterpolator node is used to change the position of a Box
# geometry.  The fraction_changed eventOut of a TimeSensor node is used
# to change the position from keyValues of
# [ 0 0 0, -2 0 0, 0 0 0, 2 0 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 2, 0 0 -2, 0 0 0, 0 2 0, 0 0 0,
# 0 -2 0, 0 0 0 ]	for keys of 
# [0.08, 0.16,  0.24, 0.32, 0.5,  0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.68, 0.76, 0.84, 0.92]respectively.
# Because key 0.5 has multiple keyValues, only the first and last 0.5 key
# are used as limits. As a result: the Box geometry will move successively 
# in the X direction, NOT move in the Z direction, then finish movement in the
# Y direction to in a 5 second interval.
