# Test of a PositionInterpolator node to continue to generate
# and receive events when outside the Transform hierarchy.
# A Switch node is the parent of a PositionInterpolator node that
# moves a Box along the X, Y and Z axis. The PositionInterpolator has
# been "switched out" by setting the whichChoice exposedField to
# -1.  The result should be, the PositionInterpolator should continue 
# send and receive events, and animate the movement of the Box.
