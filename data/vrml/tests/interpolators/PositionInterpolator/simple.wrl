#
# Test of basic PositionInterpolator functionality.
#
# A PositionInterpolator node is used to change the position of a Box
# geometry.  The fraction_changed eventOut of a TimeSensor node is used
# to change the position from keyValues of [ 0 0 0, -2 0 0, 0 0 0,
# 2 0 0, 0 0 0, 0 2 0, 0 -2 0, 0 0 0, 0 0 -2, 0 0 2, 0 0 0 ] for keys of
# [  [0.0, 0.08, 0.16, 0.24, 0.32, 0.40, 0.48, 0.56, 0.64, 0.72, 0.80, 0.88,
#     0.96]
# respectively. As a result: the Box geometry will move successively to those
# 13 positions in a 5 second interval.
