#VRML V2.0 utf8
# A cylinder-like polyhedron with the following properties:
# 1. All facets are triangles.
# 2. The top and bottom cups consists of 4 coplanar triangles each.
# 3. There are 6 slices, and accordingly 6 vertical regtangular walls.
# 4. The angle between the normals of neighboring walls is 1.04718 (60 degs)
# 5. The angle between the normal of a wall and the normal of (either top or
#    bottom) cup is 1.5708 (90 degs).
