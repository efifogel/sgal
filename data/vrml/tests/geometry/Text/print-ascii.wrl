#VRML V2.0 utf8
#
# This test writes the entire ASCII collating sequence using various strings.
# The ASCII sequence is a subset of the UTF8 character set.  The Minimum 
# Support Requirements section of the VRML specifications calls for support
# of the entire UTF8 character set.  For the time being we will only 
# concentrate on the ASCII sequence.
