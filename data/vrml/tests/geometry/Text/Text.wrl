# Map a JPG image to an Text geometry.An ImageTexture is mapped to 
# Text geometry by aligning
# the origin of the first text string with the ImageTexture origin,
# as determined by justification. S increases to the right, T increases upward.
# The top of the text represents a value of 1 in texture coordinates.The
# ImageTexture is scaled uniformly in the S and T direction. The result is a
# red and yellow square checkerboard centered vertically, and repeating
# horizontally left-to-right, with the word "TEXT" acting as a "cookie-cutter",
# with the lower left corner of the TEXT corresponding to the lower left corner
# of the first, repeating texture.
