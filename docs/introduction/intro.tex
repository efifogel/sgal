The 3D printing market could soar to \$8.4 billion in sales in~2025,
from \$777 million in~2012, fueled largely by the automotive,
aerospace, and medical markets, according a report by \lux{} Research.

Widespread adoption of 3D printing technology may not be that far away,
according to a \gartner{} report predicting that enterprise-class 3D
printers will be available for less than \$2,000 by~2016.

The Global Computer-aided Design (CAD) market is expected to post a compound
annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.60 percent during the period 2013--2016.
The market is expected to post revenue of \$8,3 billion in~2016 according
to a \technavio{} reprt.

We present a business opportunity that shows promise to make a considerable
profit within a year and a much larger profit within a couple of years. The
opportunity is in the market of CAD and is driven by the immensely grown
3D-printing market. It includes an application that extends the seemingly
capabilities of current and future 3D printers; the application enables the
3D printing of virtually any object using low cost 3D printers. The
application is based on novel techniques in assembly planning and assembly
partitioning. Similar applications do not exist in the market, to the best
of our knowledge, and we do not expect that similar applications will
suddenly emerge, simply due to the complexity of computational tasks that
need to be carried out behind the scenes.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
% =============================================================================
Three-Dimensional (3D) printing is a unique form of printing
related to traditional rapid prototyping technology. Here, a 3D
object is created by layering and connecting successive cross-sections
of plastics, metals, or other materials. The 3D printers have become
popular for rapid prototyping of product designs, but are moving into
the creation of more end-market products.

The 3D printing market could soar to \$8.4 billion in sales in~2025,
from \$777 million in~2012, fueled largely by the automotive,
aerospace and medical markets, according a report by \lux{} Research.
The auto, aerospace and medical industries are seen taking
an~84\% share of the 3D printing market, which is poised to grow
at~18\% annually, \lux{} says. Meanwhile, consumer applications will
remain small relative to industrial uses, Anthony Vicari, a research
associate at \lux, says. 3D-printed consumer goods were a \$17 million
market in~2012, led by \$10 million from custom jewelry. The consumer
market, dominated by hobbyists and artists, will grow to \$894 million
in sales in~2025, he says.

Rapid prototyping is a group of techniques used to fabricate a scale
model of a physical part or assembly using three-dimensional computer
aided design (CAD) data. The term "rapid" is relative. While the
construction of a model using contemporary methods can take anywhere
from several hours to several days, depending on the method used and
the size and complexity of the model, additive systems, i.e., 3D
printers, can typically reduce this time to a few hours, but the model
to be printed must meet some constraints. 3D printers are usually
faster, more affordable, and easier to use than other (non-additive)
fabrication technologies. However, not everything can be
printed---size and resolution are the main limitations.

The maximum resolution and size of a 3D print depends on the chosen 3D
Printer. For example, on the one hand, printing an object bounded by a
$(254 \times 381 \times 203)$~mm box can be done using the
ZPrinter\textregistered{}~650 by \zcorp{}, which costs approximately
\$100,000. On the other hand, the ZPrinter\textregistered{}~150, which
costs approximately \$15,000, enables the printing of only objects
bounded by a $(236 \times 185 \times 127)$~mm box each.

We present an application that enables the printing of large objects on
low cost printers. The application is based on novel techniques
in assembly planning and assembly partitioning. It enables the 3D
printing of virtually any object using low cost 3D printers. The eact same
application also enables the rapid production of \lego{} (or the like)
kits.

%% The resolution of the printer is given in layer thickness and XY
%% resolution in DPI (Dots Per Inch). Usually, the layer thickness is
%% approximately one hundred micrometers (0.1 [mm] (millimeters)), while
%% $XY$ resolution is comparable to that of laser printers. The particles
%% (3D dots) are approximately 50 to 100 micrometers (0.05 mm-0.1 mm) in
%% diameter.

%% The layers of material in 3D printers are approximately $0.1$~mm
%% thick. Although very fine, they are slightly perceptible to the naked
%% eye (particularly on rounded or false-flat shapes).

%% A model is printable if it consists of a set
%% of closed 2D (two-dimensional) manifolds, which bind volumes that do
%% not intersect in their interior pair-wise, and also there exists a
%% convex decomposition, such that the $z$-directional (vertical) width
%% of every convex piece is larger than a given threshold, and the
%% $xy$-directional (horizontal) width of every convex piece is larger
%% than a given threshold ($x$, $y$, and $z$ are axes).

\section{The products}
\label{sec:3d-printing}
% =============================================================================
Given a model of an object, the bounding box of which is large, and
thus can be printed only on a high-cost 3D printer or not at all, the
application automatically decomposes the input model into smaller pieces
and adds connectors to the resulting pieces, so that these pieces can be
used as building blocks, and as such can be to easily assembled to form
an object similar to the original one without any additional materials
(such as glue). The application also automatically produces the procedure
that guides the assembly.

The same application subsumes a simpler application that enables the
relatively low-cost 3D printing of models that are already decomposed
into pieces of different colors or different resolution. Given such a
model that consists of several submodels, the application simply adds
connectors at the appropriate places to the submodels so that they can
be individualy 3D-printed. The printed pieces can be assembled to form
the original object. Naturally, a combination, where a partial
decomposition is given, is also applicable.

Tipically, the application determines an optimal
decomposition of the input model into submodels of building
blocks, with optimal placement of connectors, according to
some restrictions, for example, bounding boxes imposed by
certain printers. If the building blocks are to be
3D-printed, the application also determines the appropriate
orientations of the submodels, but the building blocks do
not necessarily need to be 3D-printed; they can be taken
from any collection of existing building blocks, such as
\lego{} bricks. The application accepts several types of
restrictions on the properties of the resulting submodels.
At the extreme, the user can predetermine the exact size
and shape of the building blocks, by passing a database of
building-block prototypes to our application as input.
Figure~\ref{fig:earth} shows three examples of
decompositions into standard \lego{} bricks.
