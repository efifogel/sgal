A report by \wohlers{} predicts that additive
Manufacturing, aka 3D Printing, will reach \$3.1 billion
worldwide by~2016 and \$5.2~billion
by~2020.\footnote{\url{http://wohlersassociates.com/2011report.htm}}
According to another report, by \lux{}, the 3D printing
market could soar to \$8.4 billion in sales in~2025, from
\$777 million in~2012, fueled largely by the automotive,
aerospace, and medical markets,
Research.\footnote{\url{http://www2.luxresearchinc.com/component/content/article/164.html}}

Widespread adoption of 3D printing technology may not be that
far away, according to a \gartner{} report predicting that enterprise-class
3D printers will be available for less than \$2,000
by~2016.\footnote{\url{http://www.networkworld.com/news/2013/032713-gartner-3d-printers-268162.html}}

Computer-aided Design (CAD) software must be used to operate 3D printers.
The global CAD market is expected to post a compound annual growth rate
(CAGR) of 8.60 percent during the period 2013--2016. The market is expected
to post revenue of \$8,3 billion in~2016 according
to a \technavio{} reprt.\footnote{\url{http://www.reportlinker.com/p0841049/Global-Computer-aided-Design-Market.html}}

We present a business opportunity that shows promise to make a considerable
profit within a year and a much larger profit within a couple of years. The
opportunity is in the market of CAD and is driven by the very fast grown
3D-printing market. It includes an application that extends the
capabilities of current and future 3D printers; the application enables the
3D printing of virtually any object (large objects in particular) using
low-cost 3D printers. The application is based on novel techniques in
assembly planning and assembly partitioning. Similar applications do not
exist in the market, to the best of our knowledge, and we do not expect
that similar applications will suddenly emerge, simply due to the
seemingly complexity of the computational tasks that need to be carried out
behind the scenes.

\section{The Market}
\label{sec:market}
% =============================================================================
Three-Dimensional (3D) printing is a unique form of printing
related to rapid prototyping technology. Here, a 3D
object is created by layering and connecting successive cross-sections
of plastics, metals, or other materials. The 3D printers have become
popular for rapid prototyping of product designs, but are moving into
the creation of more end-market products.

The 3D printing market could soar to \$8.4 billion in sales in~2025,
from \$777 million in~2012, fueled largely by the automotive,
aerospace and medical markets, according a report by \lux{} Research.
The auto, aerospace and medical industries are seen taking
an~84\% share of the 3D printing market, which is poised to grow
at~18\% annually, \lux{} says. Meanwhile, consumer applications will
remain small relative to industrial uses, Anthony Vicari, a research
associate at \lux, says. 3D-printed consumer goods were a \$17 million
market in~2012, led by \$10 million from custom jewelry. The consumer
market, dominated by hobbyists and artists, will grow to \$894 million
in sales in~2025, he says.

Rapid prototyping is a group of techniques used to fabricate a scale
model of a physical part or assembly using three-dimensional CAD data.
The term \emph{rapid} is relative. While the construction of a model
using contemporary methods can take anywhere from several hours to
several days, depending on the method used and the size and complexity
of the model, additive systems, \ie 3D printers, can typically reduce
this time to a few hours, but the model to be printed must meet some
constraints. 3D printers are usually faster, more affordable, and easier
to use than other (non-additive) fabrication technologies. However, not
everything can be printed---size and resolution are the main limitations.

The maximum resolution and size of a 3D print depends on the chosen 3D
Printer. For example, on the one hand, the ZPrinter\textregistered{}~150
by \threedSystems{} Ltd., which costs approximately \$15,000, enables the
printing of relatively small objects bounded by a
$(236 \times 185 \times 127)$~mm box each. On the other hand, printing an
object bounded by a $(254 \times 381 \times 203)$~mm box can be done
using the ZPrinter\textregistered{}~650, which costs approximately
\$100,000.\footnote{\url{http://www.zcorp.com/en/Products/spage.aspx}}

%% The resolution of the printer is given in layer thickness and XY
%% resolution in DPI (Dots Per Inch). Usually, the layer thickness is
%% approximately one hundred micrometers (0.1 [mm] (millimeters)), while
%% $XY$ resolution is comparable to that of laser printers. The particles
%% (3D dots) are approximately 50 to 100 micrometers (0.05 mm-0.1 mm) in
%% diameter.

%% The layers of material in 3D printers are approximately $0.1$~mm
%% thick. Although very fine, they are slightly perceptible to the naked
%% eye (particularly on rounded or false-flat shapes).

%% A model is printable if it consists of a set
%% of closed 2D (two-dimensional) manifolds, which bind volumes that do
%% not intersect in their interior pair-wise, and also there exists a
%% convex decomposition, such that the $z$-directional (vertical) width
%% of every convex piece is larger than a given threshold, and the
%% $xy$-directional (horizontal) width of every convex piece is larger
%% than a given threshold ($x$, $y$, and $z$ are axes).

\section{The Product}
\label{sec:product}
% =============================================================================
Given a model of an object, the bounding box of which is large, and
thus can be printed only on a high-cost 3D printer or not at all, the
application automatically decomposes the input model into smaller pieces
and adds connectors to the resulting pieces, so that these pieces can be
used as building blocks, and as such can be easily assembled to form
an object similar to the original one without any additional material
(such as glue). The application also automatically produces the procedure
that guides the assembly.

The same application subsumes a simpler application that enables the
relatively low-cost 3D printing of models that are already decomposed
into pieces of different colors or different resolution. Given such a
model that consists of several submodels, the application simply adds
connectors at the appropriate places to the submodels so that they can
be individualy 3D-printed. The printed pieces can be assembled to form
the original object. Naturally, a combination, where a partial
decomposition is given, is also applicable.

Typically, the application determines an optimal decomposition of the
input model into submodels of building blocks, with optimal placement
of connectors, according to some restrictions, for example, bounding
boxes imposed by certain printers. The application also determines the
appropriate orientations of the submodels to be printed, but the
building blocks do not necessarily need to be 3D-printed; they can be
taken from any collection of existing building blocks, such as \lego{}
bricks. The application accepts several types of restrictions on the
properties of the resulting submodels. At the extreme, the user can
predetermine the exact size and shape of the building blocks, by
passing a database of building-block prototypes to our application as
input. This capability essentially enables the rapid production of
\lego{} kits. Figure~\ref{fig:earth} shows three examples of
decompositions into standard \lego{} bricks.

Correct and consistent representations of three-dimensional objects
are required by applications as varied as modeling, simulation,
visualization, CAD/CAM, finite element analysis, and 3D-printing.
However, most acquired 3D models, whether created by hand or by
automatic tools, contain errors and inconsistencies. We aim to provide
tools and services for repairing such errors and inconsistencies,
for example, transforming non-printable 3D-printable models into
printable models.
