\section{Abstract}
\label{sec:abstract}
% =============================================================================
We present a couple of applications that are based on novel techniques
in assembly planning and assembly partitioning. The first application
extends the seemingly capabilities of current 3D printers; the
application enables the 3D printing of virtually any object using low
cost 3D printers. The second application (which we intend to make
available first) enables the rapid production of \lego{} (or the like)
kits.

Similar applications do not exist in the market, to the best of our
knowledge, and we do not expect that similar applications will
suddenly emerged, simply due to the complexity of computational 
tasks that need to be carried out behind the scenes.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
% =============================================================================
Three-Dimensional (3D) printing is a unique form of printing
related to traditional rapid prototyping technology. Here, a 3D
object is created by layering and connecting successive cross-sections
of plastics, metals, or other materials. The 3D printers have become
popular for rapid prototyping of product designs, but are moving into
the creation of more end-market products.

The 3D printing market could soar to \$8.4 billion in sales in~2025,
from \$777 million last year, fueled largely by the automotive,
aerospace and medical markets, according a new report by Lux
Research. The auto, aerospace and medical industries are seen taking
an~84\% share of the 3D printing market, which is poised to grow
at~18\% annually, Lux says. Meanwhile, consumer applications will
remain small relative to industrial uses, he says. 3D-printed consumer
goods were a \$17 million market in~2012, led by \$10 million from
custom jewelry. The consumer market, dominated by hobbyists and
artists, will grow to \$894 million in sales in~2025, Vicari says.

Rapid prototyping is a group of techniques used to fabricate a scale
model of a physical part or assembly using three-dimensional computer
aided design (CAD) data. The term "rapid" is relative. While the
construction of a model using contemporary methods can take anywhere
from several hours to several days, depending on the method used and
the size and complexity of the model, additive systems, i.e., 3D
printers, can typically reduce this time to a few hours, but the model
to be printed must meet some limitations. 3D printers are usually
faster, more affordable, and easier to use than other (non-additive)
fabrication technologies. However, not everything can be
printed---size and resolution are the main limitations. 

The maximum resolution and size of a 3D print depends on the chosen 3D
Printer. For example, on the one hand, printing an object bounded by a
$(254 \times 381 \times 203)$~mm box can be done using the
ZPrinter\textregistered{}~650 by \zcorp{}, which costs approximately
\$100,000. On the other hand, the ZPrinter\textregistered{}~150, which
costs approximately \$15,000, enables the printing of only objects
bounded by a $(236 \times 185 \times 127)$~mm box each. We present a
technique that enables the printing of large objects on low cost
printers.

We present a couple of applications that are based on novel techniques
in assembly planning and assembly partitioning. The first application
enables the 3D printing of virtually any object using low cost 3D
printers. The second application (which we intend to make
available first) enables the rapid production of \lego{} (or the like)
kits.

%% The resolution of the printer is given in layer thickness and XY
%% resolution in DPI (Dots Per Inch). Usually, the layer thickness is
%% approximately one hundred micrometers (0.1 [mm] (millimeters)), while
%% $XY$ resolution is comparable to that of laser printers. The particles
%% (3D dots) are approximately 50 to 100 micrometers (0.05 mm-0.1 mm) in
%% diameter.

%% The layers of material in 3D printers are approximately $0.1$~mm
%% thick. Although very fine, they are slightly perceptible to the naked
%% eye (particularly on rounded or false-flat shapes).

%% A model is printable if it consists of a set
%% of closed 2D (two-dimensional) manifolds, which bind volumes that do
%% not intersect in their interior pair-wise, and also there exists a
%% convex decomposition, such that the $z$-directional (vertical) width
%% of every convex piece is larger than a given threshold, and the
%% $xy$-directional (horizontal) width of every convex piece is larger
%% than a given threshold ($x$, $y$, and $z$ are axes).

\section{Enabling the 3D Printing of Virtually any Object}
\label{sec:3d-printing}
% =============================================================================
Given a model of an object, the bounding box of which is
large, and thus can be printed only on a high-cost 3D printer or not
at all, the application automatically decomposes the model into smaller
pieces and adds connectors to the resulting pieces, so that these
pieces can be easily assembled to form an object similar to the
original one without any additional materials (such as glue). The
application also automatically produces the procedure that guides the
assembly.

The same application subsumes a simpler application that enables the
relatively low-cost 3D printing of models that are already decomposed
into pieces of different colors or different resolution. Given such a
model that consists of several submodels, the application simply adds
connectors to the at the appropriate places to the submodels so that
they can be individualy printed. The printed pieces can be assembled
to form the original object. Naturally, a combination is also
applicable.
