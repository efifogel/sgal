\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
% =============================================================================
\paragraph{Polygon Mesh}
A polygon mesh, also referred to as an unstructured grid, is a
collection of vertices, edges, and facets, defining the shape of a
polyhedral object in space. The facets usually consist of triangles,
quadrilaterals, or other convex polygons, since this simplifies the
application of operations on the mesh, but may also be composed of
concave polygons, polygons with holes, and degenerate polygons.
A polygon mesh consist of the geometric information and optionaly
sufficient topologic information, so that the incident relation
between the vertices, edges, and facets can be retrieved.

\paragraph{3D Model}
A 3D model is a mathematical representation of any three-dimensional
entitiy (either inanimate or living) via specialized software.
Almost all 3D models can be divided into two categories as follows:
\begin{description}
\item[Solid models] describe the volume of the objects they represent.
\item[Boundary models] describe the boundary surface of the objects
  they represent. A polygonal mesh is an example of a boundary model.
\end{description}
Solid models are more realistic, but at the same time more difficult
to construct. They are mostly used for medical and engineering
simulations, for CAD and specialized visual applications such as ray
tracing and constructive solid geometry. Boundary models are easier to
work with than solid models. Almost all visual models used in games and
film are boundary models, and all models fed to conventional 3D printers
are polygonal meshes, for example, in the STL (Stereolithography)
file-format.\footnote{See, for example,
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)}}.

\paragraph{3D Printable Model}
Correct and consistent models are required by most conventional
applications that apply operations such as modeling, simulation,
visualization, and finite element analysis to name a few. Conventional
3D printers can produce correct 3D physical objects only when fed with
correct and consistent models. However, in the case of 3D printing, an
input model must satisfy additional requirements. First, an input
model must consist of a closed and orientable
2D-manifold,\footnote{Non-orientable 2D-manifolds, such as a Klein
  bottle, and non-closed 2D-manifolds, such as a M\"obius strip
  comprise illegal input, as they do not define proper solids.} or in
simple words, the model must be watertight (which simply implies that
if you were to pour water into your 3D model, it would hold the water
you poured into it.) In some cases, it is possible to relax the
aformentioned requirement, and alow the model to consist of a set of
closed and orientable 2D-manifolds that bind pair-wise interior disjoint
volumes. (In simple words, such a model can be decomposed into several
watertight solids that do not intersect in their interior pair-wise.)
However, none of the components may float in midair defeating gravity.
Secondly, an input model must satisfy additional requirements imposed by
the designated 3D printing device. For example, there exists a convex
decomposition, such that the Z-directional (vertical) and the
XY-directional (horizontal) widths of every convex piece are larger than
two given threshold, respectively. In simple words, all parts of the
model must be sufficiently thick with respect to the resolution of the
printer. Finally, the model must be bounded by a volume, typically a box,
defined by the 3D printing device.

\paragraph{Obtaining Models}
A 3D model is created as the result of a manual or an automatic 3D
modeling process. A manual modeling process is similar to plastic
arts such as sculpting. Nevertheless, specialized software tools are
always invloved in the final creation of 3D models. A 3D model can
be algorithmically computed via an automatic procedural process, such
as constructive solid modeling
Constructive solid geometry allows a modeler to create a complex surface or object by using Boolean operators to combine objects.

A valid model
%% represented as a polygonal mesh comprises a polygon-soup (an arbitrary
%% set of polygons) that represents an artifact-free and sufficiently thick closed 2D-manifold, or a collection of closed 2D-manifolds that do not intersect each other. A valid printable model satisfies additional requirements imposed by various printing devices (different printing devices impose different requirements, as they are based on different technologies).

%% Correct and consistent representations of 3D objects are required by conventional applications, such as modeling, simulation, visualization, CAD (Computer-Aided Design), CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing), finite element analysis, and the like. However, the acquired 3D models, whether created by hand or by automatic tools, usually contain errors and inconsistencies. For example, they can contain wrongly-oriented, intersecting, or overlapping polygons, cracks, and T-junctions. In addition, polygons might be missing, and topological information can be inconsistent. Problems are caused by designer errors or software errors in the modeling tool. These errors can be compounded by data exchange problems, such as: (i) automatic transfer between CAD formats (e.g., IGES (Initial Graphics Exchange Specification), STEP (Standard for Exchange of Product model data), DXF (Drawing Interchange Format), binary files from CATIA8 (Computer Aided Three-dimensional Interactive Application) or AutoCAD), between B-Spline or NURBS-based (Non-uniform Rational B-Spline) formats; (ii) geometric transformation into an engineering analysis system (e.g., a triangular surface mesh). The techniques to reconstruct manifold models from acquired 3D models vary according to efficiency, robustness, level of automation, and other preconditions. Level of automation is measured in terms of required user input. Preconditions include requirements, such as: (i) polygons in the input set are consistently oriented; (ii) most polygons are orthogonal; or (iii) the input parts are closed 2D-manifolds. A naïve but efficient approach is to use scene-relative tolerances to "fill over'' cracks in the model or merge features within some tolerance. Boundary-based approaches that try to infer solid structures from how input polygons mesh together are likely to perform incorrectly in the presence of non-manifold geometry. All approaches do not work well when the size of errors are larger than the smallest feature in the model. As degenerate input is commonplace in practical applications and numerical errors are inevitable, an algorithm implemented while ignoring limited precision imposed by floating-point arithmetic get into an infinite loop, or just crash, while running on a degenerate, or nearly degenerate, input; see [KMP+08,Sch00] for examples.





%% The reconstruction of precise surfaces from unorganized point clouds derived from laser scanner data or photogrammetric image measurements is a very hard problem, not completely solved and problematic in case of incomplete, noisy and sparse data. The generation of polygonal models that can satisfy high modeling and visualization demands is required in different applications, like video-games, movies, virtual reality applications, e-commerce and other graphics applications. The goal is always to find a way to create a computer model of an object which best fit the real object. Polygons are usually the ideal way to accurately represent the results of measurements, providing an optimal surface description. While the generation of digital terrain models has a long tradition and has found efficient solutions, the correct modeling of closed surfaces or free-form objects is of recent nature, a not completely solved problem and still an important issue investigated in many research activities.


%% Surface reconstruction from images is an old, fundamental yet difficult problem in computer vision, which has been extensively investigated over the past three decades. Recent developments in camera calibration and multimedia computing have broadened the interests in the reconstruction problem, and the big proliferation of digital cameras and computers allow to take and process multiple images respectively. The emphasis of the nowaday applications has been shifted to generating more "appearance" views of the scene, and it requires highly detailed surfaces to be constructed within a tolerable computational resources. Such a task, however, is difficult to accomplish due to the intrinsic ill-posedness of the reconstruction, interference from image noise, and insufficiency of scalability and flexibility.

%% A point cloud is a set of data points in some coordinate system.

%% In a three-dimensional coordinate system, these points are usually defined by X, Y, and Z coordinates, and often are intended to represent the external surface of an object.

%% Point clouds may be created by 3D scanners. These devices measure in an automatic way a large number of points on the surface of an object, and often output a point cloud as a data file. The point cloud represents the set of points that the device has measured.

%% While point clouds can be directly rendered and inspected,[1] usually point clouds themselves are generally not directly usable in most 3D applications, and therefore are usually converted to polygon mesh or triangle mesh models, NURBS surface models, or CAD models through a process commonly referred to as surface reconstruction.
