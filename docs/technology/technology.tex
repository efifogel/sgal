\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
% =============================================================================
\paragraph{Polygon Mesh}
A polygon mesh, also referred to as an unstructured grid, is a
collection of vertices, edges, and facets, defining the shape of a
polyhedral object in 3D space. The facets are usually triangles,
quadrilaterals, or other convex polygons, as this simplifies the
operations applied to the mesh, but may also be concave polygons,
polygons with holes, and degenerate polygons (\eg{} antenas and
isolated vertices). A polygon mesh consists of the geometric
information and optionaly sufficient topological information, so
that the incident relation between the vertices, edges, and facets
can be efficiently retrieved.

\paragraph{3D Model}
A 3D model is a mathematical representation of any three-dimensional
entitiy (either inanimate or living, synthetic or genuine) via
specialized software. Almost all 3D models can be divided into two
categories as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Solid models} describe the volume of the objects they
  represent.
\item \emph{Boundary models} describe the boundary surface of the
  objects they represent. A polygonal mesh is an example of a
  boundary model.
\end{enumerate}
Solid models are more realistic, but at the same time more difficult
to handle. They are mostly used for medical and engineering
simulations, computer aided design (CAD), computer aided manufacturing
(CAM), computer aided engineering (CAE) and specialized visual
applications such as ray tracing and constructive solid geometry
(CSG).\footnote{In constructive solid geometry complex objects are
  obtained as the result of the application of Boolean operations,
  \eg{} complement, intersection, union, and symmetric difference, on
  other objects.} Boundary models are typically easier to work with
than solid models. Almost all models used for visualization in games
and film are boundary models. In particular, all models fed to
conventional 3D printers are polygonal meshes, for example, in the STL
(Stereolithography) file-format.\footnote{See, for example,
  \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)}}.

\paragraph{Acquiring Models}
A 3D model is created as the result of a manual or automatic 3D
modeling process. A manual modeling process is similar to plastic
arts such as sculpting, but carried out by specialized software
tools. A 3D model can be algorithmically computed via an automatic
procedural process, such as CSG, or it can be automatically
generated from scaned or captured data through a process commonly
referred to as surface reconstruction. The automatic generation of
artifact-free watertight solid models required in many applications
such as video-games, movies, virtual reality applications, e-commerce,
and 3D printing, is a collection of hard problems due to the intrinsic
ill-posedness of the methods, interference from input data in form of
noise, and limited scalability and flexibility of the known approaches.
The goal, however, is to find a way to create a computer model of an
object, which best fits the real genuine object.

\paragraph{Surface Reconstruction}
Surface reconstruction from unorganized point clouds,\footnote{A point
  cloud is a set of data points in some coordinate system, often
  intended to sample the external surface of an object. Point clouds
  can be obtained by laser scanners, which automatically sample a large
  number of points on the surface of an object or computed from
  photographic images using a process called \emph{photogrammetry}.}
has been extensively investigated over the past three decades, yet not
completely solved, and especially problematic in the presence of
incomplete, noisy, or sparse data. Recent advances in multimedia
computing and camera calibration and the development of less constly,
less cumbersome, and more accurate, 3D scanners and cameras enabled
significant progress in surface reconstruction from poit clouds. This
approach best targets models that are invariant to changes in color,
texture, and minor within class shape deformation. Another approach,
which is not limited to the reconstruction of the prototypical shape of
an object but can also capture the ``appearance'' of the object, is
surface reconstruction from several photographic images shot from
different viewpoints. This approach has a shorter research track, and
while considered harder to apply, has also seen significant progress
due to recent advances in \emph{machine vision},\footnote{Machine vision
  is the a computational discipline that covers imaging-based automatic
  inspection.} and the increase of computational resources in general.

\paragraph{Transforming Models}
Models that are not represented as polygon meshes, that are, models
in solid representation, \eg{} the result of CGS, and boundary
models represented by \emph{freedom surfaces}, \eg{} B-Spline or
NURBS-based (Non-uniform Rational B-Spline), must be transformed
into polygon meshes before they can be 3D-printed, a process
referred to as \emph{tessellation}. In general, models that are not
in the STL format must be transformed to the STL format to be
3D-printed, and there are many formats out there, \eg{} IGES (Initial
Graphics Exchange Specification), STEP (Standard for Exchange of
Product model data), DXF (Drawing Interchange Format), binary files
from CATIA (Computer Aided Three-dimensional Interactive Application),
and DWG.
%% The techniques to reconstruct manifold models from acquired 3D models
%% vary according to efficiency, robustness, level of automation, and
%% other preconditions. Level of automation is measured in terms of
%% required user input. Preconditions include requirements, such as:
%% (i) polygons in the input set are consistently oriented;
%% (ii) polygons are orthogonal; or
%% (iii) the input parts are orientable closed 2D-manifolds.
%% A naive but efficient approach is to use scene-relative tolerances to
%% "fill over'' cracks in the model or merge features within some
%% tolerance. Boundary-based approaches that try to infer solid
%% structures from how input polygons mesh together are likely to perform
%% incorrectly in the presence of non-manifold geometry.

\paragraph{Corrupted Models}
Acquired 3D models, whether created by hand or by automatic tools,
usually contain errors and inconsistencies. For example, they can
contain wrongly-oriented, intersecting, or overlapping polygons,
cracks, and T-junctions. In addition, polygons might be missing, and
topological information can be inconsistent. Problems are caused by
designer errors or software errors in the modeling tool. These errors
can be compounded by data exchange problems, such as: (i) automatic
transfer between CAD formats, and (ii) geometric transformation into
an engineering analysis system.

\paragraph{3D Printable Model}
Correct and consistent models are required by most conventional
applications that apply operations such as modeling, simulation,
visualization, and finite element analysis, to name a few. Conventional
3D printers can produce correct 3D physical objects only when fed with
correct and consistent models. However, in the case of 3D printing, an
input model must satisfy additional requirements. First, an input
model must consist of a closed and orientable
2D-manifold,\footnote{Non-orientable 2D-manifolds, such as a Klein
  bottle and the M\"obius strip (which is also non-closed) comprise
  illegal input, as they do not define proper solids.} or in simple
words, the model must be watertight (which simply implies that if you
were to pour water into your 3D model, it would hold the water you
poured into it.) In some cases, it is possible to relax the
aformentioned requirement, and alow the model to consist of a set of
closed and orientable 2D-manifolds that bind pair-wise interior disjoint
volumes. (In simple words, such a model can be decomposed into several
watertight solids that do not intersect in their interior pair-wise.)
However, none of the components may float in midair defeating gravity.
Secondly, an input model must satisfy additional requirements imposed by
the designated 3D printing device. For example, there exists a convex
decomposition, such that the Z-directional (vertical) and the
XY-directional (horizontal) widths of every convex piece are larger than
two given threshold, respectively. In simple words, all parts of the
model must be sufficiently thick with respect to the resolution of the
printer. Finally, the model must be bounded by a volume, typically a box,
defined by the designated 3D printing device.

\paragraph{Alligning Models}


\paragraph{Robust, Efficient, and Complete}
All approaches
do not work well when the size of errors are larger than the smallest
feature in the model. As degenerate input is commonplace in practical
applications and numerical errors are inevitable, an algorithm
implemented while ignoring limited precision imposed by floating-point
arithmetic get into an infinite loop, or just crash, while running on
a degenerate, or nearly degenerate, input; see [KMP+08,Sch00] for examples.

\paragraph{\cgal}
The Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (\cgal) is a software
library that aims to provide easy access to efficient and reliable
algorithms in computational geometry. The code is written in C++ and
rigorously adheres to the generic programming paradigm. \cgal{} follows
the exact geometric-computation paradigm, which simply amounts to
ensuring that errors in predicate evaluations do not occur.

\cgal{} is used in various areas needing geometric computation, such
as, computer graphics, scientific visualization, CAD/CAM, geographic
information systems, molecular biology, medical imaging, and many more.
\cgal{} has a variety of components that are useful in robotics and
automation: Minkowski sums, offset polygons, Boolean operations on
curved regions, Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations to mention
just a few relevant components. For automation in particular the high
precision of \cgal{} allows for solving geometric problems involving
motion in tight quarters, such as arise in assembly planning.

The software is available under open source licenses. In particular,
it is publicly and freely available for academic use. For more
information see the \cgal{} website, \url{http://www.cgal.org}.

\paragraph{2D Arrangements}

\paragraph{Assembly and Partitioning}
assembly and partitioning: non-trivial theory; very difficult to implement: requires reduction to complex arrangements
such as arrangements on a sphere, and searching for optimal solutions through such arrangements

\paragraph{3D Graphics}
The partitioning process is realized within a software library we
have developed, called Scene Graph Algorithms Library (\sgal{}).
\sgal{} supports the construction and maintenance of directed
acyclic graphs that represent scenes and models in \Rthree. The
library comes with an application, called \emph{player}, that enables
users to visualize the scene in an interactive manner. The
\emph{player} parses input files that describe the scene in a
degenerate yet extended \vrml{}
format.\footnote{\url{http://www.web3d.org/}} The format is degenerate,
as not all \vrml{} features are supported (yet). However, it has been
extended to support all the necessary ingredients required to represent
and visualize the input, the simulation of the process, and the output.
In particular, it has been extended with two geometry node types: the
\myLstinline{Assembly} node type represents assemblies or subassemblies,
and the \myLstinline{AssemblyPart} node type represents parts of
assemblies. The format has been extended in the past with other related
geometry node types, such as the \myLstinline{SphericalGaussianMap}
node type, which represents (spherical) Gaussian maps of convex
polytopes in \Rthree, and the \myLstinline{ArrangementOnSphere}, which
represents arrangements of geodesic arcs embedded on the sphere. The
extended format also supports a node type called
\myLstinline{ExactCoordinate}, which represents exact coordinates, and
enables the provision of exact rational coordinates as input.
%% \footnote{We plan to offer \sgal{} with an open-source license in
%%   the future, making it available to the public.}
Each node object of the three types \myLstinline{AssemblyPart},
\myLstinline{SphericalGaussianMap}, and \myLstinline{ArrangementOnSphere}
internally maintains the \cgal{} data structure that represents an
arrangement of geodesic arcs embedded on the sphere~\cite{bfhks-apsca-10}.
